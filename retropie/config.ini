# Description:
#
# Each section is the name of an emulator. Each section contains a single map file used
# to find the buttons that are active for any games.  If a game is not found in the map
# file, the buttons listed in the section will simply by lit up as a default.
#
# Each of these sections then has a map of game button, to controller button.
# The left value is the button name within the mapfile, the right value is the Bxx 
# button name on the board. 

# The final main button name to controller output.  
# The key in this section is the value of the buttons
# in the other system sections.  eg. in snes X=B6 is mapped 
# back to here where B6 is mapped to the controller output 6
# The Player and Coun values are assumed to be always used
# for a given controller.  If PLAYER and COIN are found 
# here, they will be included in the controller flashes
