# Event Horizon - Illuminate Joystick Controller 
Last Updated (May 1 2021)
This project is now back into active development.  The software and hardware is pretty much ready to go. The documentation is still being worked on, but it should be enough to get most people started.

Like many of us, I was annoyed by the lack of LED control from the standard zero-delay joystick conrol boards.  All they did was light up every button LED.  I wanted to light up only the buttons that were used for any given game.   Since I couldn't find any inexpensive control boards that could do it, I made my own.

Event Horizon Illuminate Joytick is a RetroPie joystick and button encoder board that also controls the LEDs in the Buttons.  Lighting up ONLY the buttons used by the game you're playing.  A nearly drop-in replacement (size and plugs) for the common zero-delay encoder boards used by many retropie builds.  Only works with 5v LED buttons.  Non-Led buttons will almost certainly burn up the control board.  Make sure your buttons are 5v LEDs.

# TODO / Wishlist / Future Upgrades:
- Provide an automatic package installer for retropie systems.
- Add auto-config support to retro arch? (https://github.com/libretro/retroarch-joypad-autoconfig/blob/master/hid/8BitDo_Zero2_gamepad_BT.cfg)
- command-line firmware update
- command-line game configuration update
- Ready Made complete `.zip` archive for easier install.
